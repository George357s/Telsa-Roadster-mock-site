# Telsa-Roadster-mock-site
A full modern website clone with on scroll animations and responsive sidebars.
A clone of the Telsa Roadster website using a QuickCodingTuts video as a reference. Some of the things I learned from this project is How to-
- Build a full website clone with a responsive design
- Implement the AOS library to make smooth on scroll animations
- Use JS to add custom animations on scroll
- Build a responsive navbar and collapsible sidebar
- Add responsive videos to the website
- Build advanced CSS flexbox layouts

                                                          Version 1.1 update

I've also fixed the Javascript from my first commit that was broken and also fixed the AOS animations to actually work properly. 
Another thing I've added is a scroll animation to change the roof image on a scroll event via Javascript. 
The landing page is now complete!
